The user has provided a filter rule for this session. Apply it literally.

Decision rule:
- If the title/channel match the user's "Junk" criteria → output "Junk"
- Otherwise → output "Stay"
- When uncertain, lean "Junk" — the user wants discipline, not lenience.

Reply with EXACTLY one word: "Junk" or "Stay". No punctuation, no explanation, no quotes.`;
